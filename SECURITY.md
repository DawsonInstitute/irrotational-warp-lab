# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This repository is primarily research software. Security fixes are handled on a best-effort basis.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue:
- Prefer a private report (do not open a public issue with exploit details).
- Include steps to reproduce and any relevant logs.

If private reporting is not possible in your environment, open a minimal public issue describing the impact without exploit details.

## Dependency guidance

- Keep dependencies up to date (`pip install -U ...`).
- Use virtual environments.
- Avoid running untrusted notebooks or scripts.
